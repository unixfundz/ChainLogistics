# ChainLojistic - Decentralized Supply Chain Tracking

## 🌍 Project Overview

ChainLojistic is an open-source, blockchain-based supply chain provenance tracker built on Stellar's Soroban platform. It enables transparent, tamper-proof tracking of products from origin to consumer, solving trust and verification issues in global supply chains.

## 🎯 The Problem

Modern supply chains face critical trust challenges:

- **No Transparency**: Consumers can't verify product claims (organic, fair-trade, sustainable)
- **Counterfeit Products**: $4.5 trillion lost annually to fake goods
- **Broken Trust**: 73% of consumers don't trust company sustainability claims
- **Paper Trail Failures**: Documents are easily forged, lost, or altered
- **Data Silos**: Each party maintains separate records, creating inconsistencies
- **Fraud & Waste**: $40+ billion lost annually in supply chain fraud

**Real Examples:**
- Coffee labeled "fair trade" but farmers received standard prices
- "Organic" produce treated with pesticides
- Electronics with conflict minerals despite "ethical sourcing" claims
- Counterfeit medications killing 250,000+ people annually

## 💡 The Solution

ChainLojistic provides a decentralized, immutable ledger for supply chain tracking:

### Core Features

**1. Product Registration**
- Register products at origin with complete details
- Cryptographic proof of authenticity
- Unique blockchain ID for each item

**2. Event Tracking**
- Record every step: harvest, processing, shipping, quality checks
- Timestamp and location data
- Multi-party authorization (farmers, processors, shippers, retailers)

**3. Verification**
- QR code scanning for instant verification
- Complete product journey visible to consumers
- Tamper-proof records on blockchain

**4. Transparency**
- All stakeholders see the same data
- No single point of control
- Immutable audit trail
